# Python AI Travel Planner

A Python-based travel planning agent that uses OpenAI's function calling with web search capabilities to create detailed, real-time travel itineraries.

## Features

- 🔍 **Real-time web search** using Serper API
- 🤖 **OpenAI GPT-4** with function calling
- 🌍 **Any destination** worldwide
- 📅 **Custom date ranges**
- 🎯 **Personalized preferences** (culture, adventure, etc.)

## Quick Start

### 1. Setup (One time only)
```bash
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

### 2. Run the Agent

**Option A: Default Morocco Example**
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
python planner_agent.py
```

**Option B: Custom Destination**
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
python planner_agent.py "Build an itinerary for a trip to Japan from 15 to 22 March 2025, focusing on cherry blossoms"
```

**Option C: Interactive Mode**
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
python planner_agent.py "Plan a 5-day cultural trip to Rome in September 2025"
```

## Example Queries

- `"Build an itinerary for a trip to Morocco from 8 to 14 december 2025"`
- `"Plan a 7-day adventure trip to Nepal focusing on hiking and mountains"`
- `"Create a cultural tour of Italy for 10 days in spring 2025"`
- `"Design a relaxing beach vacation in Thailand for 2 weeks"`

## Features in Action

The agent will:
1. **Create a detailed day-by-day itinerary**
2. **Search the web** for current information about:
   - Opening hours and entrance fees
   - Seasonal events (festivals, weather)
   - Transportation options
   - Local recommendations
3. **Provide practical advice** about timing, bookings, and logistics

## Files Structure

- `planner_agent.py` - Main agent script
- `requirements.txt` - All optional dependencies
- `requirements-minimal.txt` - Essential dependencies only
- `setup.sh` - Automated setup script

## API Keys Required

The agent uses hardcoded API keys for demo purposes. For production:
- OpenAI API key (for GPT-4)
- Serper API key (for web search)

## Deactivate Environment

When done:
```bash
deactivate
```

## Comparison with Rust

| Feature | Python Agent | Rust Agent |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| Development Speed | ✅ Very Fast | ⚪ Moderate |
| AI Ecosystem | ✅ Excellent | ⚪ Limited |
| Performance | ⚪ Good | ✅ Excellent |
| Real-time Search | ✅ Built-in | ✅ Custom implementation |
| Iteration Speed | ✅ Immediate | ⚪ Compile required |

Both approaches work well - Python for rapid AI development, Rust for production performance and integration with existing backend.
